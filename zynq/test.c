/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides three demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, a more comprehensive test and demo application, and an lwIP example.
 * The mainSELECTED_APPLICATION setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the three.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and
 * described in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application
 * is implemented and described in main_full.c.  The lwIP example is implemented
 * and described in main_lwIP.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 * !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!
 * The GCC libraries that ship with the Xilinx SDK make use of the floating
 * point registers.  To avoid this causing corruption it is necessary to avoid
 * their use.  For this reason main.c contains very basic C implementations of
 * the standard C library functions memset(), memcpy() and memcmp(), which are
 * are used by FreeRTOS itself.  Defining these functions in the project 
 * prevents the linker pulling them in from the library.  Any other standard C
 * library functions that are used by the application must likewise be defined
 * in C.
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
